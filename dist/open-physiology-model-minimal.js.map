This means if `func` makes AJAX request, that request\n     * will be made every time someone subscribes to resulting Observable, but not before.\n     *\n     * Optionally, selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. That function\n     * takes the same arguments as callback, and returns value\n     * that will be emitted by Observable instead of callback parameters themselves.\n     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as array,\n     * selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as callback would.\n     * This means you can imagine default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n     * as function that aggregates all its arguments into array, or simply returns first argument,\n     * if there is only one.\n     *\n     * Last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when call\n     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default subscription to Observable calls `func`\n     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,\n     * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler\n     * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,\n     * will end before `func` is invoked.\n     *\n     * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted\n     * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,\n     * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.\n     * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.\n     * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`\n     * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n     *\n     * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value\n     * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from\n     * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to\n     * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or\n     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n     *\n     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set\n     * to the same context that output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n     * is called as method of some object, in order to preserve proper behaviour,\n     * it is recommended to set context of output function to that object as well,\n     * provided `func` is not already bound.\n     *\n     * If input function calls its callback in \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n     * optional error parameter signaling whether call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions without any difference and error parameter\n     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\n     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Receive array of arguments passed to callback</caption>\n     * someFunction((a, b, c) => {\n     *   console.log(a);

This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n * );\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\n * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n *\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @static true\n * @name combineLatest\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction combineLatest() {\n    var observables = [];\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n        observables[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n    }\n    var project = null;\n    var scheduler = null;\n    if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n        scheduler = observables.pop();\n    }\n    if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n        project = observables.pop();\n    }\n    // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n    // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], project)`\n    if (observables.length === 1 && isArray_1.isArray(observables[0])) {\n        observables = observables[0];\n    }\n    return new ArrayObservable_1.ArrayObservable(observables, scheduler).lift(new combineLatest_1.CombineLatestOperator(project));\n}\nexports.combineLatest = combineLatest;\n//# sourceMappingURL=combineLatest.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ../~/rxjs/observable/combineLatest.js\n// module id = 1241\n// module chunks = 0 1","\"use strict\";\nvar concat_1 = require('../operator/concat');\nexports.concat = concat_1.concatStatic;\n//# sourceMappingURL=concat.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ../~/rxjs/observable/concat.js\n// module id = 1242\n// module chunks = 0 1","\"use strict\";\nvar DeferObservable_1 = require('./DeferObservable');\nexports.defer = DeferObservable_1.DeferObservable.create;\n//# sourceMappingURL=defer.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ../~/rxjs/observable/defer.js\n// module id = 1243\n// module chunks = 0 1","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?
